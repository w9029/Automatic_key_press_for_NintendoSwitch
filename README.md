### Introduction ###
To do the automatic lottery in Xenoblade2, I changed the code of [Switch-Fightstick](https://github.com/progmem/Switch-Fightstick) and successfully freed my hands.


This code using an Arduino, make it emulates a Nintendo Switch controller connected via USB, and then a prepared sequence of press can be executed.
